# Project CLyman

[![Docker Automated build](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/jrottenberg/ffmpeg.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://hub.docker.com/r/aostreetart/clyman-automated-build/builds/)

## Overview

This is a C++ microservice which synchronizes high-level 3-D object attributes across many user devices.  The goal is to synchronize the position, rotation, and scale of virtual objects projected into a real space.

This service is intended to fill a small role within a larger architecture designed to synchronize 3D objects across different client programs.  It is highly scalable, and many instances can run in parallel to support increasing load.

Features:
* Storage of 3-D Objects Location, Rotation, Scaling
* Enable real-time change feeds on the objects which are stored
* Connect to other services over Zero MQ using JSON or Google Protocol Buffers.
* Configurable Logic
* Scalable microservice design
